# Arlo's Big Bag o' Kompleted Katas

I'm playing with a bunch of katas. You can follow along if you want. In general, these are katas that all start with a blank initial state...but that might change.

Each kata completion is in its own branch, with a branch path name that matches the kata name. I might include rules and readmes per kata...or I might not. We'll see.
